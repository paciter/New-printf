This project has been created as partof the 42 curriculum by rubfacci

The goal of the ft_printf project is to recreate the standard C printf function
This function allows formatted output and implementing it helps strengthen understanding of variadic functions, format specifiers, and memory management in C

The function supports multiple conversion specifiers such as %c, %s, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, and %p
Each specifier is handled carefully to correctly format the output according to the rules of the standard printf

The main challenges of the project include handling a variable number of arguments using va_list, converting numbers to strings in decimal, hexadecimal, or unsigned formats, managing edge cases such as NULL strings or zero values, avoiding memory leaks while dynamically generating strings

my ressource was medium my old printf. 
This project is a great exercise in low-level C programming combining string manipulation, pointer arithmetic, and robust error handling all while respecting the strict coding standards of 42
